# Websites

## Designed by Me
I eventually want to put together a nice showcase website,
but until then, here's a boring list:

*In no particular order*
* <https://isitvegan.app/>
* <https://polyadic.github.io/funcky/>
* <https://www.myelin.ch/>
* <https://broccolini.tau.garden/>
* <https://unicodefractions.com/>
* <https://game-night.tau.garden/>

## Inspirations
Here's a collection of websites that look
